##This project aims to develop an Emotion-Based Music Recommender System using Facial Recognition. 
The system leverages technologies like Streamlit WebRTC module, OpenCV, Keras, and Mediapipe to capture and analyze facial expressions in real-time. 
Basically, the System using facial recognition is designed to enhance the music listening experience by tailoring music recommendations based on the user's emotional state detected through facial expressions. 
The detected emotions are then used to recommend suitable music tracks, providing a personalized and immersive music listening experience.
